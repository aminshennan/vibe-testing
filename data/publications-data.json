Using advanced neuroimaging techniques combined with behavioral assessments, we identified optimal conditions for learning and developed evidence-based educational interventions. Our findings reveal that structured learning environments with active engagement protocols show 34% improved memory consolidation compared to traditional lecture-based approaches.",
